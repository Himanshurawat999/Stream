# 🎮 STREAM - Watch The Film

Welcome to **STREAM** – your new go-to platform for finding movies when you're stuck wondering, _"What should I watch tonight?"_ 🍿

---

## 🚀 What Does STREAM Do?

STREAM helps you discover films with a smooth, snappy interface and a dash of swag. Whether you're hunting down the latest blockbuster or in the mood for a cult classic, STREAM makes movie browsing effortless, fun, and maybe just a little bit quirky.

## 🤖 What Is STREAM Built With?

This isn’t just any ol’ movie website. Nope! STREAM is powered by some seriously cool tech:

- **React JS**: For building a fast, dynamic, and highly responsive UI that won’t leave you buffering (nobody likes buffering).
- **Redux Toolkit**: Because keeping track of movie data without it would be like juggling popcorn in the dark.
- **React Router DOM**: So you can hop from one movie page to another with ease, just like flicking through Netflix without the endless scrolling.
- **Vercel**: Instant deployment because, let’s face it, waiting is for the movies, not for loading a website.

## 🎥 Feature List

- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on any screen size—so whether you're on your phone, tablet, or pretending to work on your laptop, STREAM has you covered.
- **Lightning Fast**: Instant load times so you can spend more time watching and less time waiting.
- **Easy Navigation**: **React Router DOM** ensures seamless transitions—no one likes getting lost when trying to watch the next big hit.
